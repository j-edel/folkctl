# folk CLI skill

Use this skill when the user wants to work with folk.app CRM data through the first-party folk API and does not want a third-party connector.

## Tooling

The CLI command is `folkctl`. It is designed for OpenClaw-style agent use:

- `--json` for machine-readable output
- `--dry-run` before mutations when you need to preview requests
- `--all` to follow pagination
- `--no-input` to fail instead of prompting
- `--yes` or `--force` only when the user has explicitly confirmed the deletion, group replacement, or credit spending it skips
- Exit code `5`: Folk accepted a batch, but at least one record failed (or a waited enrichment failed). Read each result's `status`.

Every write sends an `Idempotency-Key`, and retries reuse it, so a retried write runs once. If a write ends with a network error, its outcome is unknown: re-run the same command with `--idempotency-key <the idempotencyKey from the error>` instead of a plain re-run, which could create duplicates.

Never print, log, or include `FOLK_API_KEY` in responses. Prefer environment variables over stored config in automated environments.

## First checks

Run these before doing unfamiliar work:

```bash
folkctl --version
folkctl api ls
folkctl api docs people.list
folkctl people --help
```

When a command is missing or the schema is unclear, use the generic escape hatch:

```bash
folkctl api request GET /v1/users/me --json
folkctl api request POST /v1/people --data '{"firstName":"Ada"}' --dry-run --json
```

## Authentication

For OpenClaw, expect `FOLK_API_KEY` to be set in the environment:

```bash
export FOLK_API_KEY="fk_live_..."
folkctl auth status
```

For local setup:

```bash
printf '%s' "$FOLK_API_KEY" | folkctl auth login --token-stdin
```

## Common tasks

### List or search people

```bash
folkctl people list --limit 20 --json
folkctl people search "Ada Lovelace" --json
folkctl people list --filter fullName:like:Ada --json
```

### Create a person

Preview first:

```bash
folkctl people create \
  --first-name Ada \
  --last-name Lovelace \
  --email ada@example.com \
  --group-id grp_123 \
  --dry-run --json
```

Then run without `--dry-run` once confirmed.

### Create or update companies

```bash
folkctl companies create --name "Acme Inc" --url https://acme.example --group-id grp_123 --dry-run --json
folkctl companies update com_123 --name "Acme Corporation" --dry-run --json
```

On people and company updates, `groups` (and `--group-id`) replaces the record's groups: each group left out is removed, with the record's custom field values in it. To add a group, read the record first and send its current groups plus the new one. On create, `groups` only adds. To change a custom field in a group the record is already in, send `customFieldValues` without `groups`. List fields (`emails`, `phones`, `urls`, `addresses`, person `companies`) also replace the existing values on update: send the full list.

### Batch create, update, and delete

Use batch commands for more than a few records: up to 100 per request, each applied on its own.

```bash
folkctl people batch create --data @people.ndjson --group-id grp_123 --dry-run --json
folkctl people batch update --data '[{"id":"per_123","jobTitle":"CEO"},{"id":"per_456","jobTitle":"CTO"}]' --dry-run --json
folkctl companies batch update com_123 com_456 --industry Fintech --dry-run --json
folkctl people batch delete per_123 per_456 --dry-run --json
folkctl objects batch create --group-id grp_123 --object-type Projects --data @projects.json --dry-run --json
```

`--data` takes a JSON array, `{"records": [...]}`, or NDJSON. Resource flags apply to every record. `batch update <id>...` applies one change to each ID. Results come back in request order with a `status` per record. Exit code 5 means at least one record failed: report the failed records to the user by index and error, and retry only those, in a new command. Split inputs larger than 100 records.

`companies batch create` updates an existing company with the same name instead of creating a duplicate (`operation: "updated"`). Object batch create never matches existing objects, so do not re-run it after an unclear failure without the original `--idempotency-key`. Object `people` and `companies` are given by ID and must already be in the group.

### Discover groups and custom fields

```bash
folkctl groups list --json
folkctl groups fields grp_123 person --json
folkctl groups fields grp_123 company --json
folkctl groups fields grp_123 Deals --json
folkctl groups members list grp_123 --json
folkctl groups fields get grp_123 person "Status" --json
folkctl groups create --name "Partners" --visibility private --dry-run --json
folkctl groups members add grp_123 usr_123 --role reader --dry-run --json
folkctl groups fields create grp_123 person --name "Region" --type textField --dry-run --json
```

Use `groups fields update` with raw JSON for `addOptions`, `updateOptions`, and `removeOptions`. Removing options also removes their associated contact data and requires the same confirmation as deletion. Names containing spaces must be quoted.

### Deals

folk deals are addressed under a group and an object type, usually the name of the deal object field, for example `Deals`.

```bash
folkctl deals list --group-id grp_123 --object-type Deals --json
folkctl deals create --group-id grp_123 --object-type Deals --name "Project Alpha" --company-id com_123 --person-id per_123 --custom Status=Active --dry-run --json
folkctl objects list --group-id grp_123 --object-type Projects --json
folkctl objects create --group-id grp_123 --object-type Projects --name "Website launch" --dry-run --json
```

`objects` exposes the same API for any custom object type. Discover the exact group and object type names before creating or updating records.

### Notes and interaction history

```bash
folkctl notes create --entity-id per_123 --content "Met at SaaStr. Follow up next week." --visibility private --dry-run --json
folkctl notes search "contract renewal" --created-after 2026-08-01T00:00:00Z --all --json
folkctl interactions past --entity-id per_123 --all --json
folkctl interactions upcoming --entity-id per_123 --json
folkctl interactions list --entity-id per_123 --imported-type email,call --json
folkctl interactions list --entity-id per_123 --logged-only --json
folkctl interactions get lit_123 --entity-id per_123 --json
folkctl interactions create --entity-id per_123 --date-time 2026-09-06T09:00:00.000Z --title "Coffee" --content "Discussed the new project." --activity-type coffee --dry-run --json
folkctl interactions update lit_123 --entity-id per_123 --content "Updated notes." --dry-run --json
```

Interaction history and editing are in open beta. Reads need the linked entity ID; update needs it in the body (`--entity-id` constructs it). `--imported-type` (email, calendar, whatsapp, call) narrows imported history but always keeps logged interactions; `--user-id` keeps only interactions of those workspace members, logged ones included. Only manually logged interactions can be updated or deleted. Imported email, calendar, WhatsApp, and call content may be hidden by workspace privacy rules; missing content is not evidence that an interaction never occurred. Calls appear as soon as they are dialed: `content.status` separates `completed` calls from `ongoing` ones, ones still `processing` into a summary, and `missed` or `failed` ones that never connected. Expect interaction types you do not recognize.

### Enrichments and credits

Enrichment finds missing emails and phones for up to 500 people and spends workspace credits for each one found. Only start it when the user asks, for the people and fields they chose.

```bash
folkctl credits --json
folkctl people enrich per_123 per_456 --fields emails --dry-run --json
folkctl people enrich per_123 per_456 --fields emails --yes --wait --json
folkctl enrichments get enr_123 --wait --json
folkctl enrichments list --status pending,in_progress --json
```

Check `credits` first and tell the user how many people and fields the request covers. Pass `--yes` only after they confirm. `--wait` polls until the enrichment completes; report the `summary`. If waiting fails or times out, the enrichment is still running: follow the `Resume with:` command in the error rather than starting a new enrichment. People with `not_enriched` or `partially_enriched` list `missingInputs` (such as `linkedinUrl` or `company`) that may help a later attempt. A `402` means the workspace lacks credits, and nothing was charged.

### Tasks and follow-ups

```bash
folkctl tasks list --only-assigned-to-me --empty completedAt --all --json
folkctl tasks list --entity-id per_123 --filter dueAt:lt:2026-09-30 --json
folkctl tasks create --entity-id per_123 --title "Follow up" --due-at 2026-09-08 --due-time 09:00 --is-public=false --dry-run --json
folkctl tasks update tsk_123 --due-at 2026-09-10 --description "Review the proposal." --dry-run --json
folkctl tasks done tsk_123 --completed-at 2026-09-08T14:00:00Z --dry-run --json
folkctl tasks todo tsk_123 --dry-run --json
```

Use real user-supplied dates and identifiers. `dueAt` is a date, `dueTime` is an optional `HH:mm` time, and `recurrenceFrequency` is weekday, weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or null. Tasks default to public in the API; set `--is-public=false` when a private task is intended. Completion is a deliberate POST action; do not send `completedAt` through `tasks update` or mark work complete merely because its due date has passed.

Task `--entity-id` uses `filter[entity][in]`; task text search is not supported. Existing `reminders` commands remain available but are deprecated and are not automatically migrated. Folk's sunset documentation differs between February 11 and 13, 2027; migrate before the earlier date and consult the live endpoint's `Sunset` header and [migration guide](https://developer.folk.app/migrations/reminders-to-tasks).

### Official MCP setup

```bash
folkctl mcp info --json
folkctl mcp config codex
folkctl mcp config cursor
```

These commands print offline setup snippets for `https://mcp.folk.app/mcp`. Merge them with existing client configuration and authenticate through the client's OAuth flow. The REST API key is separate from MCP authentication. `folkctl` does not execute MCP tools or run an MCP server. For current tools and schemas, use [Folk's MCP reference](https://developer.folk.app/mcp/tools).

### Webhooks

```bash
folkctl webhooks list --json
folkctl webhooks create --name "My app" --target-url https://example.com/webhook --event person.created --dry-run --json
folkctl webhooks create --name "Enrichment done" --target-url https://example.com/webhook --event person_enrichment.finished --dry-run --json
```

## Safety rules

Before create/update/delete commands, prefer `--dry-run --json` and summarize the exact resource, method, path, and body for the user. For batches, summarize the record count and a few representative records.

For deletes, do not pass `--yes` or `--force` unless the user explicitly asks to delete the exact record or records. If the user has not confirmed, run a dry-run or ask for confirmation.

For batch updates that set `groups`, explain that each record leaves every group not listed and loses its custom field values there, and get confirmation before `--yes`. For enrichments, get confirmation of the people, fields, and credit use before `--yes`.

If the API returns 401/403, tell the user to verify or rotate `FOLK_API_KEY`. Do not ask them to paste secrets into chat.

## Installation hint

Skill 0.3.0 targets CLI 0.3.0. If `folkctl` is missing, install the immutable CLI source used in [v0.3.0](https://github.com/j-edel/folkctl/releases/tag/v0.3.0), which adds batch commands, enrichments, credits, and idempotent retries:

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts github:j-edel/folkctl#4a9c2af28427432beee018561f5f43e3ecfc2645
folkctl --version
```

The expected CLI version is `0.3.0`. The commit pin fixes the installed source even if the default branch or release tag changes. Its CLI source and package metadata match the release tag; the tag also includes this updated companion skill. This release has no runtime dependencies or installation lifecycle scripts. Complete installation and check the version before making `FOLK_API_KEY` available to the CLI.
